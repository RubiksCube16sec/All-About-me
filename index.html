<h1>My family</h1>
    <h4>So, I have 4 people in my family, but I will also tell you about my cousins, aunts and uncles.</h4>
    <h5>1. My dad: my dad was working at a dealership and as a real estate agent. But now we've moved. So, to keep things easy he started a LG show room!</h5>
    <h5>My mom: my mom used to be a teacher. But ever since we've moved, she hasn't got a job because she doesn't want one. But we have just opened up a rubiks cube class in our society. So far we've had 3 students. But ever since I made friends, they got inspired and wanted to take the classes when I showed them how I solve the cube. My mom makes the best food ever!</h5>
    <h5>My little sister: She is 6 years old. She also knows how to solve the rubiks cube, but she is out of practice. Her fastest time is 1 minute 21 seconds. It is fast for age, isn't it? </h5>
